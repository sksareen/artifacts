# JustBuildApps

## Why (build this)?

With AI the ability to build a complete computer program (i.e. app) from scratch is easier than ever before. But the tools available are still completely focused on engineers or a computer programmer. While this makese sense historically, there is a major opportunity to expand the user base of who can build an app.

While today the bar to building your own webapp or program feels like you have to understand technical jargon and a lot of friction to even get started. With JustBuildApps it is much easier.

The same way Instagram lowered the entry point for people to be photographers or marketers, Shopify lowered the entry point to be small business owners, and YouTube lowered the entry point for video creators.

JustBuildApps will lower the entry point for app creation, and create a new revolution of app creation.

## Who (is this for)?

The target users for JBA is non-technical users. This means that the target audience is not engineers or computer programmers. The target audience is anyone who wants to build an app. Who this includes will adjust over time both as the app grows and as the user base grows. One great use base to have early on based on the knowledge and tendencies of the demographic, is gamers with no coding background.

## What?

Today our world is modeled around how we spend our time. A huge influence of that today is what apps we choose to, or allow ouselves, to use. We spend time infront of the TV for entertainment, using social media for information sharing, and ecommerce portals for shopping. But these are all consumption points. What about our creating and sharing points? Well we do create and share pictures, songs, videos, blogs and more on a wide variety of platforms. And each of them are pretty engaging too. Is there anything that does both well? Let's take a second to look at gaming.

Play a game is an instance where you're consuming and creating content in real time. You are erading what's happening, analyzing the world and finding possible paths and decisions, and then by virtue of making those decisions and actions you have a real impact on the game and the world around you.

Take Tetris as an example. You play by watching the blocks fall and by choosing which blocks to place where. The game is incredibly engaging and changed the world when it first released. This is how games have evovled over time. Today simulation games are even a popular form of gaming.

But what about the app creation points? In my experience not only are these more intersting, they are 10x more engaging. I personally have become addicted to building apps, more so than if I was playing a video game.

We can take the high engagement of gaming and apply it to app creation. Yes we're about to change the world.

## How (will it work)?

Target User Journey

1. Open JustBuildApps.com
2. Enter prompt (suggestions included)
3. App is created, visible in-browser
4. Prompt to edit the app (suggestions included)
5. App is created, live, interactive
6. Share link to app

## Where (will it be available)?

The app will be deployed on the web, and accessible from any device. Initially, users will get started by opening the webapp to minimize friction and barrier to entry from the first step. Future instances will include a mobile app (iOS and Android), and a desktop app (Windows and Mac), with Apple platforms taking priority. Native apps will help extend the capabilities of JustBuildApps and enalbe a highly engaging cross-platform experience.

## When (can I use this)?

We are in active development and are looking for contributors. Prior coding experience is not required, however an understanding of React webdevelopment framework is a strong plus. If you have spent time analyzing, critiquing, or thinking about apps you'd like to create please reach out.
