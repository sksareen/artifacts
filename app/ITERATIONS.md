## Iteration 1

### What Went Well

- server is connected, server health checks run periodically
- server status indicator
- styling

### What Didn't Go Well

- I expected npm run dev to make the FE and BE start at teh same time but I still ahve to run node server.js in another terminal
- code is not generating. if it is it's not appearing at all
- app preview isn't working
- some issue with jbartifacts?
- the layout and style doens't look too impressive. let's make it more simple with the look and feel of tiktok

### Next Steps

- tell me how to monitor the API response in real time in console or elsewhere, because the error says it can't find jbartifact tags
