# Why

AI has changed the game

I want everyone to be able to build apps for themselves because:

1. It's fun - i love building apps. everyone I see who does it loves it more than they coudl imagine. I want everyone to be able to experience this.
2. It's useful - you can build for your exact use case. why submit a feature request when you can just build the feature yourself.
3. It saves money - everything is a paid saas app today. You could automate so much of your workflow and day if you

This is for you if:

1. you have no coding experience
2. you have some coding experience but want to move easier
3. you have deep coding experience but want to build fun things faster

Common challenges people run into we want to solve:

1. getting started
2. deploying to make it easily available
3. distribution to get users
4. help, guidance, feedback along the way
